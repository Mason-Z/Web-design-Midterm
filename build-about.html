					Original: ファウスト/Faust<br>
					This is a hostile organization. The technique in the Pandora's Box is used for evil, and human experiments that inject nebula gas into humans are repeated, and the mysterious organization of Smash is successively created. One of the purposes is to create an extremely vital life. War rabbits and dragons are the subjects of this human experiment

					Original: ネビュラガス/Nebura Gas<br>
					The special gas extracted from the wall of the sky has the effect of dividing cells. Used by Ge Chengqiao and Faust for human experiments. The person who is injected into the nebula gas will become Smash, but the War Rabbit and the Dragon are special cases, so they are highly concerned by Faust.

					Original: ハザードレベル/Hazard Level<br>
					Faust's term, used to measure the level of Smash and War Rabbit, which was technically modified by Pandora's Box, is essentially the tolerance of the experimental personnel to the nebula gas.
					When the hazard level is 1.0, the injected nebula gas will die immediately. When the hazard level is 2.0, it will become Smash after being injected into the nebula gas. Very few people with a hazard level of more than 2.0 can maintain human appearance after being injected with nebula gas. When the hazard level reaches 3.0 or above, you can transform into a Kamen Rider, and when you reach 5.0, you may merge with Evolto.
					Hazard levels can be enhanced by combat and feelings (except for the smoke system). The use of "dangerous starters" can effectively improve the level of danger, but is defeated and killed for Smash, while Build is easy to get out of control.
